<script>
	alert('Hello!');	// for allert message
</script>

function hello(){
	//something;

typeof()	// operator
data types are of two types: 1) primitive(undefined, null, number, string, boolean) 2) referenced(all object like array)

TYPE CONVERSION:
String(num)
Number(str)
parseInt(35.8)
parseFloat(768.3)
number.toFixed(2)	// 2 places of decimal

ary1.unshift(34)	// to insert in front of array ary1
ary1.shift(34)		// to pop from front
ary1.splice(1,4)	// splice is used to delete element from 1 index upto 1+4-1

== its loosly coupled and checks for equivalence of values
=== it along with value also checks for type equivalence

a = prompt("Type your name")	// this input text and set it to a
a = confirm("Are you sure")	// this prompts yes and and cancel option, and assign true or false in accordingly
